# LDPC_Decoder
low density parity check decoder for communicational channels using MATLAB

Low density parity check codes are used by modern digital communicational technologies such as 5G for handling errors and noices introduced by communicational channels. The message bits are encoded using the encoder and then only passed to the communication channel, upon receiving the decoder decodes the encoded message and gives back the original message bits. We have implemented the decoder using MATLAB and refrerring algorithms described in paper by Bernard on the LDPC codes. The algorithm uses Tanner Graph representation which is a bipartite graph containing check nodes and variable nodes. As the algorithm moves forward the more strongly known values(known with more certainity) helps us predict the values of other nodes. The decoder could be implemented in 2 ways of belief propagation, hard decoding or soft decoding. While hard decoding could be easier to implement, soft decoding is probabilistic decoder and is more accurate and practical. We have implemented the decoder for the BEC (/BSC with a few changes), verified the success ratio and the algorithm convergence of decoder successfully decoding the original message signal by decoding the bit values for erasures or decoding the probabilities of values being 0 or 1 by performing the Monte Carlo simulations, and compared the results with the theoretical results.
